/**
 * Project 1
 Miles-to-kilometers converter
Create a variable that contains a value in miles, convert it to
kilometers, and log the value in kilometers in the following format:
The distance of 130 kms is equal to 209.2142 miles
For reference, 1 mile equals 1.60934 kilometers.

* Project 2
BMI calculator
Set values for height in inches and weight in pounds, then convert
the values to centimeters and kilos, outpuÄ´ing the results to the
console:
1 inch is equal to 2.54 cm
2.2046 pounds is equal to 1 kilo
Output the results. Then, calculate and log the BMI: this is equal to
weight (in kilos) divided by squared height (in meters). Output the
results to the console.
